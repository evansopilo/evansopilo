# Hello, folks! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionated Software Developer from Nairobi, Kenya with focus on backend and cloud development. I love bulding software that leverage different cloud technologies and architectures to deliver highly scalable, secured, fault tolerant software systems that meet end-users.

I enjoy turning complex problems into simple and intuitive solutions.

When Iâ€™m not programming, I focus on my hobbies which are: article writing, playing video games and growing my network.
